# Python Functions

## Purpose
  This repo will hold random python functions I have made as a way to keep them in one spot.

## Contents
* [howmanylines.py](howmanylines.py) - This will ask the user for a directory selection and calculate how many lines of code are in all the .c, .cpp, .h files in that directory and all of the subdirectories. The file extensions can be changed in the source.
